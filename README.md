# Robotics for arm manipulation:

Means-end, practical reasoning using Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) architecture.

## Goal
Create a succeeding and a failing scenario, for a:
- Robotic arm manipulator.
- Carrying objects from a desk to a container.

### Questions & Answers:
Q: What is the robot doing? A: ACTION or FAILED

Q: Why is it doing it? A: GOAL

Q: How well is it doing it? A: STATUS & REMAINING PLAN

Q: What else could it have been doing instead? A: ALTERNATIVE PLANS

### Robotic arm
LewanSoul LeArm (60 gram servos, serial I/O):
- 6 degrees of freedom.
- Primitive control: servo positions in [500, 2500].

### Communication
Wi-Fi 2.4GHz with ESP32 (Arduino compatible micro-controller):
- Restful API (GET/PUT) for servo position, speed and delay.
- Average Round Trip Time (RTT):  1-2ms (warmed, after 2 packets).

### Perception
Logitech C920 camera for computer vision:
- 1920 x 1080 max resolution (3 MP), 30 max frames per second.

### Computer Vision
Object position detection (centimeter-level 3D detection of QR code) with partial obscuring (Python library: OpenCV):
- Oriented far and Rotated Brief (ORB) [RRKB11] feature detection.
- Fast Library for Approximate Nearest Neighbors (FLANN) [MM11] feature matching and homography perspective transformation.
- Pixels-to-XYZ: RANdom SAmple Consensus (RANSAC) [FB02].

### World Model (now & history):
- JSON in-memory nested data-structure for fast I/O.

### Planner
- Hierarchical Task Network (HTN) [EHN94, GNT16]. Python library: pyhop.

### Control
- Arm: Forward and Inverse kinematic model.
- Gripper opening control: From centimeters 2 [0:5; 6:0] to servo value [500; 2500].
- Trajectories: Discretization of start and target position of end-effector.
- Collision avoidance: Knowledge-based on target object location, dimensions & action (i.e
moveTo, moveUp, moveAbove etc).

### Monitoring
- Events: From sensor percepts , to event firing.
